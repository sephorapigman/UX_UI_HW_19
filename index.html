                    <h3> Communication & Collaboration</h3>
                    <p > Communication bridges the gap between the design world and clients. Communication is essential for conveying reasoning and implemented design strategies. A designer should always lean on their teams and stakeholders to ensure everyone is pleased with the progession of the design process. Without collaboration, hours of work could be wasted and stakeholders can lose faith in their design team.

                    <p >
                        After synthesizing research from interviews and field studies, prototyping begins. Using paper and pen first to get an idea of the IA. After prototyping, wireframing begins, using Figma. Through a series of iterations from either usabilty tests or A/B testing, eventually a High fidelity wirefreame is born and sent off to developers.
